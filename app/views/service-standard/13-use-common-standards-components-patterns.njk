## Summary

Use open standards, common components and patterns, and create new ones if there is not one that already meets your needs.

## Why it's important 

<a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles#Defining-open-standards' target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">Open standards  (opens in new tab)</a> saves money and makes use of best practice.

Using common components, patterns and technology stacks means you don't have to solve problems that've already been solved. By using a component, pattern or stack that's already been assured and extensively tested, you can provide users with a good experience in a cost effective way. It also speeds up delivery and reduces risk.

We encourage teams to develop components and patterns that meet a shared need, it's important to share them so that others can benefit from your work.

## How to meet this standard in every phase

You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this standard at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>. However, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed, it's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard point.

#### Things to consider:

- teams have reached out to other teams and similar services to consider possible patterns, <a href='https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#common-components' target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">architecture components (opens in new tab)</a> and tools 
- <a href='https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#common-tooling' target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">open source tools (opens in new tab)</a> and frameworks have been chosen or considered as the basis for the service components
- using <a href='https://design-system.service.gov.uk/' target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">GOV.UK Design System (opens in new tab)</a> common components and patterns
- evidence of a <a href="https://design-histories-beta.herokuapp.com/">design history </a> to keep track of design decisions, options explored and rationale for choices made 
- recording <a href="https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/standards/architecture-documentation/#architecture-documentation" target="_blank">architecture decision records (opens in new tab)</a> to track decisions and rationale
- how to share and encourage use of <a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/design-system/contribute/">new and existing design patterns </a> and <a href="https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/common-components/#common-components">architecture components </a>within the wider DfE service community

## Profession specific guidance

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
