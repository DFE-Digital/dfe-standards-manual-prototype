<p>You will receive an email when the report is ready to read. This should happen around 3 days after the peer review takes place.</p>

<p>See an <a href="/report/">example discovery peer review report (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to expect in a report</h2>
<p> The report will contain 3 sections.</p> 

<p>These include a summary of how the team have demonstrated an understanding of users and their needs. And, how the team have understood the problem space.</p>

<p>The discovery will also be given an overall RAG (red, amber green) status with a description of what this means. Including specific recommendations the team need to action.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Discovery RAG status descriptions</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Red</h3>
<p>There are serious concerns or recommendations the team should address before continuing. The team may want to consider escalating issues or problems to their senior responsible officer or senior leadership team. They might want to consider stopping the discovery at this point</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Amber</h3>
<p>There are some recommendations. At this point, the team may want to look at whether or not they continue or revisit the purpose of the discovery. This may result in running another discovery or evidencing improvements in an alpha assessment.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Green</h3>
<p>The team is on the right track.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accept or challenge the report</h2>

<p>Once you've read the report, the product or delivery manager have 10 working days to accept or challenge it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">To accept the report</h3>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">To challenge the report</h3>
<p>Email the service assessment team at <a href="mailto:serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk">serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk</a> to arrange next steps. They'll set up a meeting for the team with the panel to talk through the report. You will need to agree any changes to the report with the panel before you accept it. </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
