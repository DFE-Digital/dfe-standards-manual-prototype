    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to book</h2>

<p>When you start your discovery you should plan to book your peer review so that it happens near the end of your discovery.</p>

<p>However, you should request this at least 5 weeks in advance so the Service Assessment team has time to arrange a panel. 
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who should attend</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Itâ€™s recommended that the following team members attend:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li> user researcher</li>
  <li> delivery manager</li>
    <li> product manager</li>
  <li> designer</li>
</ul>

<p>But bring the people you feel have the most knowledge of your discovery. This might be the whole team.</p>
