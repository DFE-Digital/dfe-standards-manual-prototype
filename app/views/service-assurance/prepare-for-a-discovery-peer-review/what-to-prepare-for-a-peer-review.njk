<p>Think about the best way to show the narrative of your discovery.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Include things like:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li> how you've explored the problem space</li>
  <li> who are your users and their needs</li>
  <li> existing services that meet your users' needs</li>
  <li> any current user journeys</li>
  <li> any existing policy or solution constraints</li>
  <li> next steps to take</li>
</ul>
<p>These pointers are taken from things teams should consider in the discovery phase for <a href='/'>standards 1 to 7</a>. Show what you've done to explore these at your peer review.</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  What you show could be a mixture of sharing Lucid boards, docs, and sketches. It could include slides but it doesn't have to.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to expect during a discovery peer review </h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">After you request the review</h3>

<p>You'll recieve an email with next steps. This includes how to share links to artefacts for the panel to read. For example Lucid boards, docs or slide decks. You can add links to work in progress, it doesn't need to be finished, it just gives the panel an idea of the discovery. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">One to 2 days before</h3>
<p>The team will have a call with the panel. This is a chance for everyone to meet and agree what will happen during the session.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">On the day</h3>
<p>Peer reviews are 2 hours. People who attend include members of the discovery team and a peer review panel. The panel usually includes a user researcher, designer and product or delivery manager. There may also be silent observers for learning and development opportunities.</p>

<p> How you want the review to run is for you to agree with the panel. You could, for example, agree to have 45 minutes to an hour Show & Tell, with the remaining time for questions and answers. You should aim to explore the problem space, the users and agree next steps.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">After the review</h3>
<p>The panel will aim to complete the report within 3 days. The service assessment team will review and share it with the team.</p>

<p>The report will include a <a href="/service-assurance/after-discovery-peer-review/getting-the-report">RAG (red, amber, green) status</a> for the discovery, feedback and recommendations for next steps.</p>
